            <h4>Name: くどう しんいち(Kudou Shinichi)<br><br>
              Shinichi, a high school student, is equivalent to a modern Sherlock Holmes. 
              However, he turns into a small kid after being forced into consuming a deadly pill. 
              He is professional at soccer and uses his soccer practice to train his body and mind. 
              His close friends include another high schooler, Ran Mouri, 
              and his next door neighbor and inventor, 
              Dr. Agasa. All the high school girls swoon Shinichi, which often makes Ran jealous.
